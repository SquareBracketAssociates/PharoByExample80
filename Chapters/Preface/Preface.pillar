!!Preface

This version of the book is based on the previous version authored by: Andrew P. Black, Stéphane Ducasse, Oscar Nierstrasz, Damien Pollet, Damien Cassou and Marcus Denker called, ''Pharo by Example''. It is also built on the version that was issued for Pharo 50 named ''Updated Pharo by Example'' authored by: Stéphane Ducasse and edited by Dmitri Zagidulin, Nicolai Hess, and Dimitris Chloupis.
The current version received many edits, modifications and updates to bring the book to the current version of Pharo.

Keeping a book up to date is not an easy task. It's not just a case of changing a 5.0 into an 9.0. It is often tedious and boring work. Many aspects of Pharo tooling have changed, and we have updated the book to cover these changes:

- We briefly cover the new system browser, Calypso. 
- This book version has two new chapters covering Iceberg and package management (see Chapters *@cha:Iceberg* and *@cha:Configure*) - to supplement this, a new book on Pharo and git is available at *http://books.pharo.org*.
- We have simplified the SUnit chapter, since a companion book is now available at *http://books.pharo.org*/
- We have revised parts of the books that were wrong in previous editions, such as the Morphic chapter; the current version is a considerable improvement over ''Pharo by Example 5''.

''Pharo by Example'' does not magically update itself; improvements come from people's hard work. This is why I decided, as one of the original and main author over the years, to invite Sebastijan, Gordana and Quentin to be listed as authors of ''Pharo by Example 9''.

!!!What is Pharo?

Pharo is a modern, open-source, dynamically-typed language which supports live coding and is inspired by Smalltalk. Pharo's ecosystem is composed of six fundamental elements:

- A dynamically-typed language with a syntax so simple it can fit on a postcard, and yet is readable even for someone unfamiliar with it.
- A live coding environment that allows the programmer to modify code while the code executes, without any need to slow down their workflow.
- A powerful IDE providing tools to help manage complex code and promote good design.
- A rich library that creates an environment so powerful that it can be viewed as a virtual OS, including a very fast JITing VM and full access to OS libraries and features via its FFI.
- A culture where changes and improvements are encouraged and highly valued.
- A community that welcomes coders from any corner of the world with any skill in any programming language.

Pharo strives to offer a lean, open platform for professional software development, as well as a robust and stable platform for research and development into dynamic languages and environments. Pharo serves as the reference implementation for the Seaside web development framework available at *http://www.seaside.st*.

Pharo's core contains only code that has been contributed under the MIT license. The Pharo project started in March 2008 as a fork of Squeak (a modern implementation of Smalltalk-80), and the first 1.0 beta version was released on July 31, 2009. Since then Pharo reached a new version every year or year and a half. The current version is Pharo 9.0, released in July 2021.

Pharo is highly portable. Pharo can run on OS X, Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, and Raspberry Pi. Its virtual machine is written entirely in a subset of Pharo, making it easy to simulate, debug, analyze, and change from within Pharo itself. Pharo is the vehicle for a wide range of innovative projects, from multimedia applications and educational platforms to commercial web development environments.

There is an important principle behind Pharo: Pharo does not just copy the past, it ''reinvents'' the essence of Smalltalk. However we realize that Big Bang style approaches rarely succeed. Pharo instead favors evolutionary and incremental changes. Rather than leaping for the final perfect solution in one big step, a multitude of small changes keeps even the bleeding edge relatively stable while experimenting with important new features and libraries. This facilitates contributions and rapid feedback from the community, on which Pharo relies on for its success. Finally Pharo is not read-only: changes from the community are integrated daily. Pharo has around 100 contributors, based all over the world. You can have an impact on Pharo too! Check *http://github.com/pharo-project/pharo*.

!!!Who should read this book?

The previous revision of this book was based on Pharo 5.0. This revision has been liberally updated to align with Pharo 9.0. Various aspects of Pharo are presented, starting with the basics then proceeding to intermediate topics.

An excellent MOOC (Massive open online course) is freely available for Pharo at *http://mooc.pharo.org*.

This book will not teach you how to program. The reader should have some familiarity with programming languages. Some background with object-oriented programming would also be helpful. 

The current book will introduce the Pharo programming environment, the language and the associated tools. You will be exposed to common idioms and practices, but the focus is on the technology, not on object-oriented design. Wherever possible, we will show you lots of examples.

There are numerous other books on Smalltalk freely available on the web at *http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks.html*.


!!!!Further reading

This does not stand alone. Here is a short commented list of other books that you can find at *http://books.pharo.org*.

- ''Learning Object-Oriented Programming, Design and TDD with Pharo''. This book teaches the key aspects of object design and test driven development. If you are learning Object-oriented programming this book will be great for you.
- ''Pharo with Style''. This book is a must read. It discusses how to write good and readable Pharo code. In just one hour, you will boost your coding standard. 
- ''The Spec UI framework''. This book will show you how to develop standard user interface applications in Pharo. 

More technical books are:

- ''Managing your code with Iceberg''. This book covers how to manage your code with git in further detail.
- ''Enterprise Pharo''. This book contains different chapters relating to the web, converters, reporting, and documentation that you need for delivering applications. 
- ''Deep into Pharo''. This book covers more advanced topics than Pharo by Example. 

And there are also books to expand your mind:

- ''A simple reflective object kernel'' revisits all the fundamental points of "objects all the way down" by taking you on a little journey to build a reflective language core. It is truly excellent.

!!!A word of advice

Do not be frustrated by parts of Pharo that you do not immediately understand. You do not have to know everything! Alan Knight expresses this as follows:

{{{latex:\begin{quote} }}}{{{html:<blockquote>}}}
''Try not to care''. Beginning Pharo programmers often have trouble because they think they need to understand all the details of how a thing works before they can use it. This means it takes quite a while before they can master Transcript show: 'Hello World'. One of the great leaps in OO is to be able to answer the question “How does this work?” with "I don't care".
{{{latex:\end{quote} }}}{{{html:</blockquote>}}}

When you do not understand something, simple or complex, do not hesitate to ask us on our mailing lists (pharo-users@lists.pharo.org or pharo-dev@lists.pharo.org), IRC and Discord. We love questions and we welcome people of any skill.

!!!Examples and exercises

We have tried to provide as many examples as possible. In particular, there are many examples that show a fragment of code which can be evaluated. We use a long arrow to indicate the result you obtain when you select an expression and from its context menu choose ""print it"":

[[[testcase=true|label=scr:script1|caption=Small example|language=Smalltalk
3 + 4
>>> 7 "if you select 3+4 and 'print it', you will see 7"
]]]

In case you want to play with these code snippets in Pharo, you can download a plain text file with all the example code from the Resources sidebar of the original book's web site: *http://books.pharo.org/pharo-by-example*.
